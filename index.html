    Inside Out (2015) is an animated film by Pixar that takes place largely inside the mind of an 11-year-old girl named Riley. 
    The story is centered around her five core emotions—Joy, Sadness, Fear, Anger, and Disgust—who personify her inner emotional world. 
    When Riley's family moves to a new city, she struggles with the changes in her life. Inside her mind, Joy and Sadness accidentally get lost, leaving Fear, Anger, and Disgust in charge. 
    As Joy and Sadness work to return, they learn the importance of all emotions in helping Riley navigate her experiences, highlighting that sadness and joy often coexist.
